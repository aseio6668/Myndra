# Myndra Core Development Plan
*A focused roadmap to create a complete, testable programming language (no network features)*

---

## üéØ Goal: Complete Testable Programming Language

Based on analysis of current TODOs and stubs, here's what we need to implement for a fully functional Myndra language that you can actually program with:

---

## üìã Critical Core Features (Must Have)

### **1. Parser & AST System** üå≥
**Current Status**: Lexer partially implemented, parser is stub  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Nothing works without this

- [ ] **AST Node Definitions** 
  - Expression nodes (binary ops, literals, identifiers)
  - Statement nodes (assignments, declarations, control flow)
  - Function definitions and calls
  - Block statements and scoping

- [ ] **Recursive Descent Parser**
  - Expression parsing with operator precedence
  - Statement parsing (let, fn, if, while, for)
  - Function definition and call parsing
  - Error recovery and reporting

- [ ] **Parser Integration**
  - Connect lexer tokens to parser
  - Build complete AST from source
  - Proper error messages with line/column info

### **2. Type System & Semantic Analysis** üîç
**Current Status**: Completely stubbed  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Needed for type safety

- [ ] **Basic Type System**
  - Primitive types: int, float, string, bool
  - Function types and signatures
  - Array/vector types
  - Type inference where possible

- [ ] **Symbol Table**
  - Variable scope management
  - Function declaration tracking
  - Type checking and validation
  - Duplicate declaration detection

- [ ] **Semantic Analyzer**
  - Type checking for expressions
  - Variable usage validation
  - Function call verification
  - Control flow analysis

### **3. Code Generation & Execution** ‚ö°
**Current Status**: Completely stubbed  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Need to actually run programs

- [ ] **Choose Execution Strategy**
  - Option A: Tree-walking interpreter (faster to implement)
  - Option B: Bytecode VM (better performance)
  - Option C: LLVM backend (complex but powerful)

- [ ] **Basic Interpreter/VM**
  - Variable storage and retrieval
  - Function call stack management
  - Arithmetic and logical operations
  - Control flow execution (if/else, loops)

- [ ] **Standard Library Core**
  - Print/output functions
  - Basic math operations
  - String manipulation
  - Array/collection basics

### **4. Context-Aware Features** üìç
**Current Status**: Partially implemented in lexer  
**Priority**: HIGH - This is what makes Myndra unique

- [ ] **Context System**
  - Context detection (dev/prod/test)
  - Context-sensitive compilation
  - Conditional statement execution based on context
  - Context switching at runtime

- [ ] **Context-Aware Syntax**
  - `if context == "dev"` statements
  - Context-based imports
  - Debug/logging that only runs in dev context

---

## üöÄ Enhanced Features (Should Have)

### **5. Basic Language Features** üìù
**Current Status**: Needs implementation  
**Priority**: HIGH - Essential for practical programming

- [ ] **Control Flow**
  - if/else statements
  - while and for loops

  - Function definitions with parameters
  - Return values and statements
  - Local variable scoping
  - Recursion support

- [ ] **Data Structures**
  - Arrays and indexing
  - Basic structs/objects
  - String operations
  - Collections (Vec, Map basics)

### **6. Error Handling** üõ°Ô∏è
**Current Status**: Basic error reporting exists  
**Priority**: HIGH - Essential for usability

- [ ] **Improved Error Messages**
  - Precise error locations
  - Helpful suggestions
  - Multiple error reporting
  - Color-coded output

- [ ] **Basic Error Handling**
  - Result/Option types
  - Error propagation
  - Try/catch equivalent
  - Runtime error recovery

## üé® Nice-to-Have Features (Could Have)

### **7. Live Code Features** üîÑ
**Current Status**: Stubbed, complex to implement  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Unique but not essential for testing

- [ ] **Basic Live Reload**
  - Function hot-swapping
  - Variable state preservation
  - Simple capsule system

### **8. Reactive Programming** ‚ö°
**Current Status**: Completely stubbed  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Advanced feature

- [ ] **Basic Observables**
  - Simple reactive variables
  - Change notifications
  - Basic event system

### **9. Temporal Types** ‚è∞
**Current Status**: Completely stubbed  
**Priority**: LOW - Advanced feature, not essential

- [ ] **Basic Temporal System**
  - Time-varying values
  - Simple animations
  - Timeline management

## üìä Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **Already Working:**
- Basic lexical analysis (tokens)
- Build system and project structure
- REPL framework
- Basic compiler infrastructure

### ‚ùå **Major Missing Pieces:**
- Parser (completely missing)
- AST (just stubs)
- Type system (completely missing)
- Code execution (stubbed)
- Context system (partially implemented)

### üîß **Needs Completion:**
- File reading in compiler
- Error handling improvements
- Value printing in REPL
- Test framework integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Implementation Approach

### **Start With Tree-Walking Interpreter**
- Fastest to implement
- Easy to debug and test
- Good for prototyping language features
- Can optimize later with bytecode VM or LLVM

### **Focus on Core Language First**
- Get basic programs running before advanced features
- Prioritize variables, functions, control flow
- Context-aware features can come after basics work

### **Build Incrementally**
- Each phase should result in a working language
- Add comprehensive tests for each feature
- Keep examples updated as features are added

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- Lexer token generation
- Parser AST building
- Type checker validation
- Interpreter execution

- Can compile and run: Basic calculator
- Can compile and run: Simple control flow

### **Phase 2 Complete When:**
- Programs behave differently in dev vs prod context
